# git-tabular-diff

It is difficult to review changes made to csv files using a traditional Git difference.
At other times, a Git difference is more meaningful when displayed side-by-side.
The git-tabular-diff package provides both tabular and split views for these use cases.

The split view invokes the Git diff machinery,
enabling textconv display of binary files when configured.
Text files display in the split view without configuration.
A split view of a jpg image appears below.
To learn about configuring textconv, visit
[gitattributes[5]](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).

Settings allow ignoring case and/or white space in the tabular view.
The following screen shot shows a tabular view of csv file changes.

To use git-tabular-diff, select a file in the TreeView, Git panel, or the active text editor and
invoke either the git-tabular-diff:compare-selected-files
or git-tabular-diff:compare-selected-split command.
The commands are available from the context menus and
bound to the key sequences `alt-g alt-d` and `alt-g ctrl-d` by default.
A new Atom pane opens displaying the changes between the working tree and the head revision.
A pane is only opened if differences are found.
If multiple files are selected, the differences appear in a single pane.

Any git-tabular-diff view may be saved to a file with the saveAs `ctrl-shift-s` command.
To open the file later, select the .gtd file in the Atom TreeView and
invoke either git-tabular-diff command.
A gtd file may be shared with other git-tabular-diff users.
